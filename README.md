# Neural Networks and Deep Learning Coursework

This repository contains the code and utilities developed as part of the coursework for the "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" module. The primary project involves training a neural network model for image recognition using the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Overview

### NeuralNetwork.ipynb

The `NeuralNetwork.ipynb` Jupyter notebook is the core of this project. It includes:

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Steps to load the CIFAR-10 dataset and preprocess it for training.
- **Model Definition:** The architecture of the neural network, defined using PyTorch.
- **Training and Evaluation:** Code for training the neural network on the CIFAR-10 dataset and evaluating its performance.
- **Visualization:** Tools for visualizing training progress and results.

### my_utils.py

The `my_utils.py` file contains utility functions and classes that support the main notebook. Key components include:

- **Sequence Data Utilities:**
  - Functions for iterating over sequence data: `seq_data_iter_random`, `seq_data_iter_consecutive`
  - Data loader class: `SeqDataLoader`
  - Data loading function: `load_data_time_machine`

- **RNN Model:**
  - `RNNModelScratch`: Class for building an RNN model from scratch

- **Optimization Utilities:**
  - `train_2d`: Function for optimizing a 2-dimensional objective function
  - `show_trace_2d`: Function for visualizing optimization traces

- **Miscellaneous Utilities:**
  - `annotate`: Function for annotating plots
  - Aliases for common PyTorch functions

## CIFAR-10 Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 different classes. It is a widely-used benchmark for evaluating machine learning and computer vision algorithms.
